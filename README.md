# Speech Emotion Detection

This project uses audio signal processing and machine learning techniques to detect emotions expressed in the voice in real time. The model is trained on a dataset of vocal expressions and runs through TensorFlow.js in a web environment.

## Features

- Real-time audio capture through microphone and camera.
- Detection of vocal emotions such as:
  - Neutral
  - Happy
  - Sad
  - Anger
  - Fear
  - Disgust
  - Surprise
- Real-time visualization of detected emotions.
- Report generation with detailed statistics on dominant emotions and emotional variations.
